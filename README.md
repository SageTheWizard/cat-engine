# CAT - Code Acceptance Tester

## Goal
The CAT Engine's goal (eventually some day) is to be a modular
light weight unit test engine to be used outside of a code base.

This is useful for testing any application where it is not viable
to contain unit tests with in code (for example, embedded software)
or an external entity accessing the application is preferred (i.e.
an API)
